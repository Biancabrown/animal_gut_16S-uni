# Summary 

This repository comprises Jupyter notebooks used for the analysis in the
research article:

> Nicholas D. Youngblut, Georg H. Reischer, William Walters, Nathalie Schuster, Chris Walzer, Gabrielle Stalder, Ruth E. Ley, Andreas H. Farnleitner. Host diet and evolutionary history explain different aspects of gut microbiome diversity among vertebrate clades. (submitted to bioRxiv)


These notebooks provide a detailed account of the methods (eg., code)
used for the analyses in the publication. 

The directories and notebook files are numbered in the general order in which they
were run (although sometimes the analysis was not fully linear!).
